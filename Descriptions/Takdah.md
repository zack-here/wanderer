History-

Takdah Cantonment, as the name suggests, was a British cantonment in
India prior to independence. Many British officers of high rank from all
throughout India travelled there. Takdah, like many other towns and
villages, was abandoned by the new regime after independence. It was
only recently that people began to settle in the area. Though the
British are long gone, the spectacular structures built during the
British era can still be found. Takdah's masterpiece is located in an
old, abandoned club building about a kilometre from town. In comparison
to its surroundings, the town is higher in elevation, giving place to
cedar trees, and it is significantly cooler.

Tourist Activities-

1.  Takdah is home to some of the most scenic tea gardens in the
    Darjeeling area. You may walk down to some of them or take a local
    taxi trip to explore the tea gardens on rolling hills. Takdah's
    principal tea estates include Rungli Rungliot, Gielle, Namring,
    Jinglam, Poomong, and Teesta Valley. You may also go to the estate
    factories and observe the tea being made (in the factories usually
    remain closed).

2.  The Gielle Bhanjyang Bazaar, commonly known as Gandhi Chowk, is
    located further down from Rungli Rungliot. There used to be a statue
    of Mahatma Gandhi here, but it is no longer there. This is where
    Jinglam Tea Estate and Gielle Tea Estate meet.

3.  Takdah features a fantastic Orchid Center that spans a large area.
    It's about a half-kilometer walk from the market area to the
    6th mile. Many different types of exotic and colourful Himalayan
    Orchids are developed and grown here. Many visitors travel to Takdah
    specifically to see the Orchid Center.

4.  Takdah has a small monastery called Dechhen Pema Tshoiling
    Monastery, but it is more commonly known as Takdah Monastery.
    Following the market area, a steep uphill boulder road leads to a
    steep stairs. To get to the Monastery, you'll have to ascend several
    flights of stairs.

5.  The Lovers Meet Viewpoint, located on Peshok Road about 10
    kilometres below Lamahatta, is a beautiful site to visit
    by automobile. You may get a great view of Triveni, which is the
    confluence of the rivers Teesta and Rangeet. The confluence is near
    Melli and is accessible via Melli. Teesta White Water Rafting is
    common in this sandy delta formation.

6.  Another close destination is Mongpu, where you may see the orchid
    nurseries, the great poet Rabindranath Tagore's museum, and the
    large Cinchona plantations.

7.  Visit the beautiful orange orchards in Bara and Chota Mangwa (both
    about 12kms from Takdah). You can get a couple bottles of fresh
    orange juice from the little companies here. It tastes wonderful and

    from Takdah. The Teesta River meanders through the alpine sceneries,
