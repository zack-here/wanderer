					<h3>About Gokarna</h3>
					<br />
					<p>
						Gokarna is a city in the Karnataka district of Uttara Kannada that translates to 'cow's ear.' According to popular mythology,
						it is the location where Lord Shiva emerged from Mother Earth's incarnation in the form of a cow. The town is interspersed
						with ancient temples and is home to one of the oldest temples since time immemorial, Mahabaleshwar, which is enshrined with
						Lord Shiva. The town is roughly 59 kilometres from Karwar, 483 kilometres from Bengaluru, and 238 kilometres from Mangalore.
					</p>
					<p>
						Furthermore, the town's rural appearance has drawn the attention of many tourists and foreigners. There are numerous beaches,
						pilgrimage sites, and waterfalls that are popular tourist destinations. In fact, the town is built around the Aghanashini
						River.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, as a result of the recent tourist surge, the town now attracts both adrenaline junkies and those seeking spiritual
						calm. It is a hamlet of golden beaches called after their shapes, such as Om Beach and Half Moon Beach. The moniker "Paradise
						Beach" does not do it justice! The huge palm trees, the placid waves of the ocean rushing towards the rocks, and the evenings
						spent watching the sun fade into the ocean give the place a surrealistic feel.
					</p>
					<p>
						Aside from the beaches, there is the Mahabaleshwar Temple, which draws a large number of worshippers and saints. Yana is
						another charming village near Gokarna, with lush surroundings and rocky terrain ideal for sports such as cycling and trekking.
						Another prominent sport is mountaineering.
					</p>
					<p>
						The tranquil beaches are ideal for watersport activities such as surfing, scuba diving, snorkelling, parasailing, and jet
						skiing. If you want to participate in watersport activities, the optimum time to visit is after the monsoon, from September to
						December. Gokarna's winters are colourful, with a somewhat cool climate and beautiful green surrounds. Summers in Gokarna are
						hot and humid, followed by showers that calm the environment with significant rainfall.

					<h3 id="a3">Day 1</h3>

					<h5>Arrival at GOKARNA</h5>

					Upon arrival at Gokarna station, we escort you to the hotel. A full day of relaxation is required for acclimatisation. Lunch and
					dinner at the hotel, as well as an overnight stay. <br />

					<h3 id="a3">Day 2</h3>

					<h5>Gokarna Tour part I</h5>

					Start your day at this classic coastal vegetarian eatery, which is located just off Gokarna's main beach. It is the ideal
					breakfast spot, opening at 8:00 a.m. every day. You'll find everything here, from South Indian cuisine to Continental breakfast
					options including toast, oatmeal, corn flakes, muesli, and pancakes. You can also wash it down with a variety of teas, coffees,
					fresh fruit juices, and milkshakes. Then we go off towards Mahabaleshwar temple. The Mahabaleshwar Temple is located just a short
					distance from the seashore. It is a 4th century Dravidian style Shiva temple that attracts pilgrims from all across the country
					since it is regarded as holy as Varanasi's Shiva temple. The temple has a long and illustrious history, as well as a complex
					mythology. It opens at 6:00 a.m. for devotees and closes between 2:00 and 5:00 p.m. It is crucial to note that while inside the
					temple complex, visitors must dress appropriately. Then we head for a late lunch at Chez Christophe. Chez Christophe, a beautiful
					restaurant managed by a French couple, is a 15-minute walk along the beach heading north. It may take some time to locate, but
					asking locals for the location of a "French restaurant" should lead you here. Because the restaurant does not have a set menu, you
					must inquire about the daily specials. You will be presented with a menu of (usually) French and Continental foods from which to
					choose. Make careful to double-check the price, as a meal here might be expensive, even by Gokarna standards. Head back to the
					hotel. Dinner and overnight stay at the hotel. <br />

					<h3 id="a3">Day 3</h3>

					<h5>Gokarna Beaches</h5>

					Take a stroll down Gokarna's main beach, which will be your first taste of the sea on this vacation. There aren't many stalls or
					sheltered spaces; all that's left is the immaculate sand and crystal clear sea. So, don't forget to bring your sunscreen,
					sunglasses, and possibly an umbrella! The third day of your Gokarna adventure is dedicated entirely to the beaches! Begin your day
					with breakfast at your hotel, and then request an auto-rickshaw from the manager of the hotel to transport you to Om Beach. The
					fare should be kept to a maximum of Rs. 150. The beach's name comes from its shape, which is made up of two joined crescents that
					resemble a section of the Devanagari 'Om' symbol. The beach itself has only one road entrance, giving it a secluded vibe. Om Beach
					is a symphony of crystal clear waves, golden sand, and rocky outcroppings. You can spend the day playing games on the sand,
					frolicking in the sea, and stepping through the rock formations. Then we head for an amazing place called Half Moon Beach. You can
					leave in the late afternoon for Half Moon Beach after a fun-filled day on Om Beach. To get there, you'll have to walk for around
					an hour across a forested slope. It is the only means of accessing the beach. From cliffside vantage points, the trek will present
					you with breathtaking views of the woodland and the Arabian Sea. This short journey epitomises the phrase "getting there is half
					the joy." However, it should not be taken lightly because the path is poorly defined and the humidity is high. As a result, it's
					critical to have plenty of drinking water as well as some snacks. While walking down the beach, witness one of the most beautiful
					sunsets you've ever seen.<br />

					<h3 id="a3">Day 4</h3>

					<h5>Gokarna Tour part II</h5>

					The last day of your Gokarna trip is left aside for a bit tourism and a bit exploration of the village. Head for paradise beach
					and Belekan Beach in the morning after breakfast. The lack of shacks or restaurants on this beach adds to the comfortable
					solitude. With graffiti on the walls and strange-smelling smoke in the air, Paradise Beach is also where you'll discover the
					biggest hippy influence. It's a wonderful spot for a couple of hours on the beach. The 30-minute climb across another forested
					hill with a well-marked trail is the final phase of your tour. This trail leads to Belekan, the last beach on the major Gokarna
					strip. Another gorgeous beach with rocky outcroppings and backwaters. You can eat your lunch at one of the beachside shacks or
					cafés. This brings your Gokarna coastline adventure to a close! You can return to Gokarna by taking a 30-minute auto-rickshaw
					journey for around Rs. 150-200. Then we go towards Anshi National Park & Kali Tiger Reserve by reserving an auto-rickshaw. After a
					hearty lunch at the lodge, we begin the second part of our day with the unlikely choice of Anshi National Park. Considered to be
					one of the most endangered parks in the country, it’s a treat for bird watchers with over 200 species of birds. Kali Tiger reserve
					is also one of the fascinating wildlife wonders in Karnataka. Return to the hotel by 6 in the evening. After snacks, take a stroll
					around the place exploring local markets and souvenirs, which you can buy as memories before you head back the next day for your
					hometown. Dinner at the hotel.<br />

					<h3 id="a3">Day 5</h3>

					<h5>Depart</h5>

					Take your happy memories and return to Bangalore, from where you depart for home via train or plane. <br />
