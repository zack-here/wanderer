							<p>
								WE are Wanderers. We help people who are
								interested in traveling to remote places. We
								help tourists to book hotels in new and unique
								places where tourism is not so developed, and
								also ensure that they are provided with most
								possible services which they expect to receive
								in a modern day resort.
