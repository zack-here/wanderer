					<h3>About Chitrakote</h3>
					<br />
					<p>
						Chitrakot Waterfall is a stunning waterfall in the Bastar district of
						Chhattisgarh, India. It is located on the river Indravati. This waterfall
						reaches a height of 90 feet. This waterfall's unique feature is that while
						the water is reddish during rainy days, it appears completely white during
						summer moonlight nights.
					</p>
					<p>
						The waterfall is located at a distance of 40 km from Jagdalpur and 273 km
						from Raipur . Chitrakote Falls is the largest and most water-logged
						waterfall in Chhattisgarh. It is the most important waterfall in the Bastar
						division. It has also earned a reputation as a popular picnic spot due to
						its proximity to Jagdalpur. This waterfall is also known as the "Niagara of
						India" because of its resemblance to horse feet. The Chitrakoot waterfall is
						breathtaking, and visitors adore it. A massive water body pours from this
						water fall in the centre of the strong trees and Vindhya hills, attracting
						tourists' attention.
					</p>
					<p>
						The famed Chitrakot falls, often known as the "Niagra of India," may be seen
						at any time of year, but witnessing it during the rainy season is a more
						thrilling experience. The roar of massive water during the peak of the rain
						causes both thrills and shudders. During the rainy season, the splendour of
						these springs is breathtaking. It is acceptable for guests to come here
						between July and October. The picturesque waterfalls are surrounded by dense
						forest, which adds to their natural beauty. The river has been fully
						illuminated, illuminating this location. With the tourist light, the
						magnificence of the waterfall's cascading water may be viewed. On different
						occasions, this waterfall produces at least three and up to seven streams.
