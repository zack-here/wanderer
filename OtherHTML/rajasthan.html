					<br  />
          
					<p class="m-3">
						Kalibangn is a town in Rajasthan, India, located on the left or southern bank of the Ghaggar (Ghaggar-Hakra River) in Tehsil
						Pilibangn, between Suratgarh and Hanumangarh in Hanumangarh District. Bikaner is 205 kilometres away. It is also known for
						being located in a triangle of land at the confluence of the Drishadvati and Sarasvati rivers.
					</p>
					<p class="m-3">
						Luigi Tessitori discovered the prehistoric and pre-Mauryan character of the Indus Valley Civilization at this location. The
						Archaeological Survey of India published Kalibangan's excavation report in its entirety in 2003, 34 years after the
						excavations were completed. According to the research, Kalibangan was a key provincial capital of the Indus Valley
						Civilization. Kalibangan is notable for its one-of-a-kind fire altars and the "world's earliest known ploughed field." Around
						2900 BC, the Kalibangan region developed into what might be termed a planned metropolis.
					</p>
					<p class="m-3">
						Bhainsrorgarh Fort, also known as Bhainsror Fort, is an old fort in the Indian state of Rajasthan. Rawatbhata, 7 kilometres
						from Bhainsror, is the nearest city. Bhainsrorgarh is an impregnable fort with a surrounding region that has been inhabited
						from at least the second century BC.The fort was initially constructed by a Baniya merchant named Bhainsa Sah and a Charan
						trader named Rora Charan to safeguard their caravans from bandits.
					</p>
					<p class="m-3">
						The name of the fort comes from the combination of Bhansa and Rora. It is situated between two rivers, the Chambal and the
						Bamani. It had passed through various hands before becoming the residence of a premier noble of Mewar, the enormous territory
						surrounding Udaipur and Princely State of the Sisodia line. It has five tanks, shrines to Devi Bhim Chauri, Shiva, and Ganesh,
						and a rented mansion.

					Jaigarh Fort, Nahargarh Forts, Jal mahal, Hawa mahal, Johri Bazaar,Jantar Mantar and City Palace. Snacks and dinner back at the
					hotel. Overnight stay at the hotel.</p><br />

					<h3 class="m-3">Day 3</h3>

					<p class="m-3"> out for a 3 hour drive journey to Bikaner in the morning. Lunch on reaching the hotel, after a tiresome journey through the

					Karni Mata Temple. Dinner at the hotel. Overnight stay.</p><br />

					<h3 class="m-3">Day 4</h3>

					<h5 class="m-3">Bikaner sightseeing</h5>

					<p class="m-3"> visit Bikaner and miss the Junagarh fort, that's not possible. We set out for the majestic Junagarh fort just after breakfast.
					Initially called Chintamani Mahal, this old fort has impeccable architecture, which is so marvellous that it’d leave you

					<h3 class="m-3">Day 6</h3>

					<h5 class="m-3">Kalibangan sightseeing</h5>
          <p class="m-3">
					Eager to establish that Indus Valley Civilization was truly Indian in character, Kalibanga was taken up as a prime site and
					feverish excavation work took place in a manner more technically advanced than what was done at Mohanjodaro and Harappa. With
					scientific precision, Kalibangan was exposed to the light of the day like a body exhumed for analysis and interpretations. Though
					not as big as its counterparts across the border in Pakistan, Kalibanga nevertheless became a major site of the IVC-a monument to
					Indian history and history of man. But then came years of neglect. It seemed after the digging was over, no thought was given for
					conservation of the excavated site. Temporary solution proved completely ineffective against the fury of the elements. The
					precious evidence so painstakingly excavated finally crumbled into unrecognizable rubble. It is now over thirty years after the
					excavations stopped, and as yet there is no final report of the digging done at Kalibanga. If it was officially written, it never
					got published for public use. So today, the IVC site of Kalibanga stands not only completely destroyed but also forgotten.</p><br />

					<h3  class="m-3">Day 7</h3>

					<h5 class="m-3">Departure</h5>
					<p class="m-3"> will be escorted to the Kalibangan station , where you board the train to Jaipur station, and then a train/flight back to home
					as per your convinience. Its time to bid goodbye to the wonderful memories you made in Rajasthan. Have a safe journey homewards.</p>
