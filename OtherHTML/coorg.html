					<h3>About Coorg</h3>
					<br />
					<p>
						Wake up to the aroma of soothing coffee and take in the picturesque grandeur of this misty land of hills and streams. Coorg,
						often known as the Scotland of India, lives true to its reputation with an enticing blend of history, elegance, adventure, and
						delectable cuisine. This well-known coffee-producing hill station, located along the western ghats, is well-known for its
						jaw-dropping beautiful scenery and wealth. This misty landscape has a rich culture and a unique indigenous clan - Kodavas who
						specialise in martial arts and are well-known for their hospitality. From admiring the beauty of this magnificent destination
						to a tough hike or a deep insight into the culture at the Madikeri Fort to the thrilling experience at Abbey falls. Coorg will
						make you oscillate to the extremes in everything, from heart-melting handmade truffles to sweet heart-melting handmade
						truffles.
					</p>
					<p>
						With so many activities available in the house, this is a great place for everyone, whether you are a foodie, an explorer, an
						adventurer, or a seeker of tranquillity. Not to mention the well-known festivals of Keil Poldu (worship of weapons), Cauvery
						Shankaramana (return of the river goddess), and Huttari (harvest). With stunning mountains, a cascade of tumbling streams, and
						a feast for the eyes of flora and wildlife, this place is a must-see for everyone looking for a break from their boring 9-5
						stressful existence. Coorg is well-known for being the favoured place for hiking and white water rafting, making it an ideal
						location for thrill-seekers.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the winter afternoons, drive around the misty roads around the hills to quench your appetite for adventure. Though the
						touch of excitement is enough to pique your interest, remember to take precautions while on your adventurous journey to Coorg.

					<h3 id="a3">Day 1</h3>

					<h5>Arrival at Coorg</h5>
					Located just about two seventy kilometres away from the city of Bangalore, Coorg is easily accessible to the tourists. You'll be
					escorted from the Bangalore station/airport and after a 5-6 hour journey, we'll reach the resort at Coorg. Dinner at the hotel.<br />

					<h3 id="a3">Day 2</h3>

					<h5>Visit Kushalnagar and Namdroling Monastery</h5>

					After breakfast, we'll head out for Kushalnagar around 10 in the morning. Coorg has rich cultures, apart from the local cultures
					they give equal respect to foreign culture as well. There’s a town called Bylakuppe (5KM from Kushalnagar and 35 KM from the main
					town of Madikeri), a hub for Tibetans. And here you’ll find the famous Namdroling Monastery, also known as The Golden Temple.
					Bylakuppe is the largest settlement of Tibetans in India after Dharmashala and the largest teaching center of Nyingmapa, a lineage
					of Tibetan Buddhism. This Monastery is also home for around 6000 monks who’re peacefully living here. Take a stroll around the
					Monastery and get ready to explore the market and food joints nearby. Though ‘Kushalnagar,’ is comparatively much smaller than
					Madikeri, it makes for an amazing place for tourists to explore. Back at the hotel by evening. Dinner at the resort.
					<br />

					<h3 id="a3">Day 3</h3>

					<h5>Explore Nisargadhama and Dubare Elephant Camp</h5>
					Breakfast(complimentary) at the resort. Set out for the next adventure at 10 am in the morning for Dubare Elephant Camp.This camp
					has been started when woodcutting and logging operations were banned by the Government. There are around 100 elephants in the
					camp, and they are now being taken care of by people hired by the Government. Dubare Elephant Camp is a perfect place to
					experience the life of elephants. Here you can spend time with elephants, can feed them, get down in the river Cauvery to watch
					elephants taking bathe in the river (They charge 2 USD per person to get into the river with elephants). Lunch at 2 in a nearby
					restaurant. Then we set out for Nisargadhama. One can find a number of children playing in the arena and also within the adventure
					park, located within the premises. This forest resort makes for a great place for those of you looking for a relaxed and laid
					back, place to camp during your Coorg trip. We'll visit Chiklihole Reservoir on our way back. This amazing view point is not one
					to be missed out, and we reach here just before sunset to enjoy the fascinating scenes of nature. Return to the hotel by 7. Snacks
					and dinner at the resort.
					<br />

					<h3 id="a3">Day 4</h3>

					<h5>Get enchanted at Madikeri, Talacauvery, Omkareshwar, Raja's Seat and Abbey Falls</h5>

					After an overnight stay at the resort, tourists can make their way towards the region of ‘Madikeri.’ Located just about thirty
					kilometres away from the resort, is a region that is filled with extensive mists, rains and serene environment, unlike any other.
					The lush greenery of the lands and the stunning landscape that comes along with it, make ‘Madikeri,’ an ideal destination for your
					Coorg itinerary. Then we head for Omkareshwar temple. Omkarhswar temple is dedicated to Lord of Shiva of Hindu mythology. It is
					famous for its Gothic and Islamic mix of architecture. Temple is situated in the center of the main town. (** taking pictures
					inside the temple isn't allowed **). From Omkareshwar Temple head towards Talacauvery, which is the origin point of river Cauvery.
					On the way to Talacauvery have lunch at South Indian restaurant, there are many of them. It will take around an hour to
					Talacauvery. On reaching Talacauvery you will find a huge arch at the gate amidst the Brahmagiri hills. Talacauvery is famous for
					two things, firstly for the temple dedicated to Kaveriamma (Mother Cauvery) and secondly for the majestic views of the Brahmagiri
					hills. At 4, we head towards Abbey Falls. When it comes to the most picturesque and unique waterfalls in the hills, the ‘Abbey
					Falls,’ has got to be it. Located about seven kilometres into the stunning landscapes of the region, the waterfalls has got to be
					a must-do on your Coorg trip. This is undoubtedly one of the most popular attractions for tourists in Coorg. On our way back we
					reach Raja's seat and ‘Coorg Valley Viewpoint’. These two amazing viewpoints are not worth missing when you come to Coorg, and
					their majestic beauty can be enjoyed especially at sunset, around 6:00 pm. Return to the hotel by 7:30pm. Snacks and dinner at the
					resort.
					<br />

					<h3 id="a3">Day 5</h3>

					<h5>Trekking- Tadiandamol & Mandalpatti</h5>
					We start in the morning at around 8:30 am. Coorg houses few of the Karnataka’s highest peaks. The scenic beauty of Coorg makes
					trekking a good idea. Mandalpatti and Tadiandamol are two of the best options. Tadiandamol is Karnatak’s 3rd highest peak,
					standing 1748 meters high, and is very popular among the trekkers. This trek is 12 KM long, to and fro distance from the base
					point. Trek starts at the base of the hill at Nalkanad Palace. The terrains are quite steep right from the beginning so brace
					yourself to take on the challenge.Weather changes drastically during the trek, at one point it will be raining while at others it
					will get all sunny. Do carry your sunglasses, raincoat and a cap to cover yourself as per the weather conditions. Pack light in a
					small backpack, it will be difficult to climb otherwise. After covering some 3KM you would reach the Shola Forest checkpoint. They
					charge 2 USD per person as a fee to enter the forest area. <br />
