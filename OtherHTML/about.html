					<b> About Wanderers </b>
				</h2>
				<br />
				This website is of great help to people who are interested in
				traveling to remote places. It helps tourists to book hotels in
				new places where tourism is not so developed and provides an
				overview about the surroundings of that spot. The website helps
				tourists book their hotels, sort out their overall tour and also
				provides for the lounge(food and drinks services) for the
				customers.
				<br /><br />
				<p>
					We provide all kind of tour packages from Kashmir in north
					to Kanyakumari in south. Separately hotels in various
					tourist spots can also be booked from our site. In these
					post covid days, the development of tourism in remote places
					has increased significantly. We, team Wanderers, would
					request all to visit all those remote places and spend some
					time with nature.
