					<h3>About Ladakh</h3>
					<br />
					<p>
						Various names have been given to Leh (Ladakh) in the past. Some called it Maryul, or low land, while others called it Kha-
						chumpa. It was called Kia-Chha by Fa-Hein and Ma-Lo-Pho by Hiuen Tsang. The Brokpas from Dadarstan, who inhabited the lower
						regions of the Indus Valley, colloquially known as Sham, are claimed to have been the earliest immigrants to this land. The
						Mons, an Aryan type who initially established in Gya and spread to Rong, Shayok, Sakti Tangtse, and Durbuk, the territory
						spanning from Martselang to Khaltsi, were another wave of immigrants from Karja (Kulu).
					</p>
					<p>
						The Kargil War,in Ladakh, also known as the Kargil conflict, was an armed battle between India and Pakistan that took place in
						Jammu and Kashmir's Kargil area and elsewhere along the Line of Control from May to July 1999. (LoC). The battle is also known
						in India as Operation Vijay because it was the name of the Indian military operation that cleared out the Kargil area. During
						the war, the Indian Air Force worked alongside Indian Army ground troops to clear Pakistan Army regular and irregular troops
						from vacated Indian positions along the Line of Control. Operation Safed Sagar was the codename for this particular mission.

					on the itinerary. It was built by the Lamas of Leh in 1517 to commemorate the arrival of Guru Nanak Dev, the founder of the Sikh
					faith, deep in the Himalayas. Drive a few more kilometres to see the enchantment of Magnetic Hill, which defies gravity. When a
					vehicle is parked in neutral gear on this metallic road, it appears to slide up and down the road. We arrive to the confluence of
					the Indus and Zanskar Rivers after driving through a beautiful terrain. Return to the hotel for lunch. Evening drive to Shanti
					Stupa, a Buddhist white-domed stupa on a mountaintop near Changspa constructed in 1991 by Japanese Buddhist Bhikshu Gyomyo

					trade route. On the route, stop by the lovely valley of Deskit, Nubra's teeny-tiny capital. The Deskit Gompa, positioned on a
					rocky spur above the settlement with a spectacular view of the entire valley, will be our first stop. You can see a 106-foot high
					statue of Maitreya Buddha atop a hill at Deskit Monastery. Many deities are depicted in unique ways throughout the monastery.
